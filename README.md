numbers-c
=========

Countdown numbers game solver written in C.

Compile:

```
make
```

Usage:

```
./build/numbers <threads> <target> [<number>...]
./build/numbers - <target> [<number>...]
```

You can solve numbers games with a different count of numbers than what is
standard, but note that the memory usage grows extremely with the count of
numbers.
